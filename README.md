# ACcoding-Dataset

A graph-based dataset for supporting programming education through online judge.
A well-designed educational programming dataset is an invaluable asset for students and educators. Such a dataset enables students to continuously improve their programming performance and provides researchers with an essential source of data to determine student learning behaviors and enhance the quality of programming education.

We presents a large-scale graph-based dataset on the Online Judge (OJ) platform for programming learning. The dataset is named ACcoding and was built by Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. As of May 6, 2022, the dataset contains 4,047,652 task solution records submitted by 28,444 students on 5,559 programming tasks over six years. The dataset has been used as a shared asset for students to perform daily exercises and for universities to organize programming competitions. The sheer size of the dataset, combined with its rich feature set, gives educators the ability to track students' programming progress and select appropriate programming tasks for specific training purposes.
